We use 2 grace day for this part!! Thanks!

A debatable point in our implementation is that, if we don't add some irrelavent code in index.cpp, it fails to write correct new root to the index file
for xlarge input using the testing script. But if we test all the items in the test script seperately, it magiccally works...
And if we added some irrelavent code including some basic io operation, it doesn't work. The code we added is really nothing related to the production code, we got no idea and decided to keep them.
